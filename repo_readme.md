# AI-NEO — Adaptive Diagnostic System for Human Potentials

AI-NEO is an adaptive, interview-based AI diagnostic system built on the NEO Potentials Methodology.  
It replicates the logic of a deep 1–1.5 hour master diagnostic session using structured knowledge, adaptive questioning, and evidence-based reasoning.

The system is designed to:
- identify natural human potentials,
- detect energy sources, restoration zones, and weaknesses,
- reveal hidden shifts (biases, distortions),
- generate clear, practical reports for both client and master.

## 🧠 Core Concept

The system operates on a 3×3 matrix:

### Energy Rows
- Row 1 — Strengths (natural development, energy gain)
- Row 2 — Energy / Resource (restoration, hobbies, balance)
- Row 3 — Weaknesses (energy drain, delegation zones)

### Application Columns
- Material sphere
- Emotional sphere
- Meaning / Cognitive sphere

Their intersections form 9 core potentials (defined in `knowledge/positions.md`).

# NEO Potentials — Diagnostic Methodology

## 1. Purpose of the Methodology

This document defines the **core diagnostic logic** of the AI-NEO system.

Its goal is to replicate the reasoning, depth, and adaptivity of a **live master diagnostic session** (60–90 minutes) using:
- adaptive questioning,
- behavioral validation,
- shift detection,
- and structured interpretation.

The system does **not** function as a questionnaire.
It operates as an **interactive diagnostic interview**.

## 2. Fundamental Diagnostic Principles

### 2.1 Principle of Energy Truth
The most reliable indicator of a person’s true potential is **energy response**, not declared preferences.

Priority is given to:
- spontaneous behavior,
- childhood patterns,
- real-life choices under no social pressure,
- energy gain vs. depletion.

Verbal declarations without behavioral support are treated as **low-confidence signals**.

---

### 2.2 Principle of Natural Authenticity
Natural potentials manifest **before social adaptation**.

Key reference periods:
- childhood (5–12 years),
- early adolescence (12–16 years),
- spontaneous adult behavior in low-control contexts.

If adult answers contradict childhood markers, **childhood has higher diagnostic weight**.

---

### 2.3 Principle of Anti-Pattern Diagnostics
What a person consistently avoids, resists, or exhausts them is often **more diagnostically valuable** than what they claim to like.

Stable avoidance indicates:
- third-row placement,
- delegation zones,
- false compensatory roles.

---

### 2.4 Principle of Behavioral Validation
Statements must be validated by **behavioral evidence**:
- time allocation,
- financial spending,
- social roles,
- repeated life choices.

If no behavioral evidence exists → confidence is reduced.

---

## 3. Structural Model of Diagnosis

### 3.1 Matrix Structure

Diagnosis is mapped onto a **3×3 matrix**:

**Rows (Energy Levels):**
- Row 1 — Strengths (Energy Gain)
- Row 2 — Energy / Resource
- Row 3 — Weaknesses (Energy Drain)

**Columns (Application Spheres):**
- Material
- Emotional
- Meaning / Cognitive

Each intersection corresponds to **one potential**, defined in `positions.md`.

---

### 3.2 Diagnostic Targets

The system must determine:
1. Top 3 potentials in **Row 1**
2. Supporting potentials in **Row 2**
3. Delegation / risk potentials in **Row 3**
4. Presence and type of **shifts**
5. Internal contradictions and compensations

---

## 4. Questioning Logic (Core of AI Behavior)

### 4.1 Adaptive Interview Flow

The AI follows this loop:

1. Ask ONE question
2. Analyze:
   - content,
   - emotional tone,
   - behavioral markers,
   - energy indicators
3. Update internal hypothesis
4. Decide:
   - deepen,
   - validate,
   - contrast,
   - or move to another sphere

The next question is selected **based on the previous answer**, not sequential order.

---

### 4.2 Question Selection Rules

AI may ask a question only if:
- it exists in `question_bank.md`,
- it serves a diagnostic purpose:
  - clarification,
  - validation,
  - contradiction check,
  - shift detection.

The AI must NOT:
- rephrase questions,
- invent new questions,
- merge multiple questions into one.

---

### 4.3 Depth Control

Each potential requires:
- minimum **2 confirmations** from different contexts
- at least **1 behavioral or childhood marker**

If confirmation is weak → AI continues probing.

---

## 5. Shift Detection Logic

### 5.1 Definition of Shifts
A shift is a **distortion between natural energy and expressed behavior** caused by:
- trauma,
- survival strategy,
- social adaptation,
- parental сценарии,
- compensation mechanisms.

Shift definitions are stored in `shifts.md`.

---

### 5.2 Shift Indicators

Signals triggering shift suspicion:
- “I should”, “it’s necessary”, “it’s expected”
- pride without energy
- success accompanied by exhaustion
- rejection of pleasure
- strong moral justification of suffering

---

### 5.3 Shift Handling Strategy

When shift suspected:
1. Reduce confidence of related potential
2. Ask **contrast or childhood question**
3. Compare energy vs. obligation
4. Decide:
   - true potential,
   - compensatory role,
   - or masked weakness

Shifts are **never removed**, only acknowledged and explained.

---

## 6. Confidence Model

### 6.1 Confidence Levels

Each potential receives:
- **High confidence** — multiple consistent confirmations
- **Medium confidence** — partial or indirect confirmation
- **Low confidence** — declarative only or contradictory data

---

### 6.2 Early Stop Conditions

Diagnosis may stop when:
- Top 3 Row-1 potentials reach high confidence
- No major contradictions remain
- Maximum question limit is reached

Otherwise, AI continues.

---

## 7. Interpretation Rules

### 7.1 Row Interpretation

- **Row 1** → realization, profession, leadership zones
- **Row 2** → restoration, hobbies, emotional balance
- **Row 3** → delegation, burnout risks, compensation traps

---

### 7.2 Column Interpretation

- **Material** → body, money, systems, tangible outcomes
- **Emotional** → people, aesthetics, atmosphere, bonding
- **Meaning** → ideas, strategy, learning, worldview

---

## 8. Output Logic

### 8.1 Client Report Principles

Client report must:
- recognize the person,
- normalize their nature,
- remove guilt and self-pressure,
- avoid labels and pathology,
- suggest direction, not obligation.

---

### 8.2 Master Report Principles

Master report must include:
- full matrix placement,
- evidence per potential,
- shift explanations,
- contradictions,
- strategic recommendations.

---

## 9. Ethical Constraints

- No diagnosis of mental health conditions
- No therapy simulation
- No pressure to change personality
- No “fixing” narrative

The system supports **self-recognition and alignment**, not correction.

---

## 10. Role of AI-NEO

AI-NEO acts as:
- interviewer,
- pattern recognizer,
- hypothesis builder,
- validator,
- interpreter.

It does **not** replace a human master —  
it **scales their thinking**.
